Codespaces devcontainer public builds

Just a simple repo that sets up a Dockerfile to build a public devcontainer then also uses that same devcontainer for testing.

It also has a github action that will rebuild anytime the builds/Dockerfile changes.

You can use codespaces to test it out.

Note that this is public because I couldn't find out how to make a private github docker image work for devcontainers (there was no auth params I could find in docs).
